# Launch notes

Guluguba, Queensland, Saturday 25 June 2016

Temperature sensor real time clock malfunctioned on the day of the flight, thus no time data is associated with temperature.

Temperature sensor temperature reading operated nominally.

Flight video footage, temperature readings, flight length and flight path indicate the maximum altitude of between 25,000-30,000m (82,000-98,000ft).
